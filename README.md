# Customer Churn Prediction

This project implements a customer churn prediction model using machine learning.  
Customer churn is a major challenge for businesses, especially in competitive industries like telecom, SaaS, banking, and subscription-based services. Understanding why customers leave helps companies reduce churn, retain valuable customers, and boost long-term revenue.

This project, demonstrates how to use machine learning to predict customer churn based on historical customer data. The notebook guides you through the entire process, from loading and exploring the data to training a predictive model and evaluating its performance.


Key Objectives
Identify patterns: Analyze customer demographics, usage behavior, and account features to find patterns that contribute to churn.
Predict churn risk: Use classification algorithms to predict whether a customer will churn or stay.
Enable action: Provide actionable insights for marketing teams, customer support, and retention strategies.

Technical Highlights
Data preprocessing: Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and scales numerical features for better model performance.
EDA: Visualizes data distributions, churn rates, and correlations to understand feature importance.
Model training: Trains classification models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forest.
Evaluation: Uses metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix to assess model performance.
Prediction: Tests the trained model on new or test data to estimate churn probabilities.

Why This Matters
Predicting churn empowers companies to:
Target at-risk customers with personalized offers.
Improve customer experience and satisfaction.
Optimize retention campaigns and resource allocation.
Make data-driven business decisions.

Possible Improvements
This project can be extended by:
Using more advanced models (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM).
Tuning hyperparameters for better accuracy.
Adding additional customer behavior data for deeper insights.
Deploying the model as an API for real-time churn prediction.

Learning Outcome
By working through this notebook, youâ€™ll strengthen your understanding of:
Practical ML workflows.
Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
Evaluating classification models.
Translating data insights into business strategies.
