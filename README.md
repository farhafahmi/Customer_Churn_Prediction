# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction

This project implements a **customer churn prediction model** using machine learning.

Customer churn is a major challenge for businesses, especially in competitive industries like telecom, SaaS, banking, and subscription-based services. Understanding **why customers leave** helps companies reduce churn, retain valuable customers, and boost long-term revenue.

This project demonstrates how to use **machine learning** to predict customer churn based on historical customer data. The notebook guides you through the entire process — from loading and exploring the data to training a predictive model and evaluating its performance.

## 🎯 Key Objectives

- **Identify patterns:** Analyze customer demographics, usage behavior, and account features to find patterns that contribute to churn.
- **Predict churn risk:** Use classification algorithms to predict whether a customer will churn or stay.
- **Enable action:** Provide actionable insights for marketing teams, customer support, and retention strategies.

## ⚙️ Technical Highlights

- **Data preprocessing:** Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features for better model performance.
- **EDA:** Visualize data distributions, churn rates, and correlations to understand feature importance.
- **Model training:** Train classification models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forest.
- **Evaluation:** Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix to assess model performance.
- **Prediction:** Test the trained model on new or test data to estimate churn probabilities.
